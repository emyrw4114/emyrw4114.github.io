	<h1>This is about me, the most important things about me</h1>
	<p>when I was in 6th grade, I was accepted to a brand new program called BEAM 6. At this program a learned lots of cool maths and was in a news article(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/nyregion/new-york-math-camp.html). Then I did the 7th grade version of the same program(which is older). Those were the best summers of my life. In spring of 2018, I was accepted into Academy for Software Engineering, where I learned of a program that would teach me how to program Video Games in the Unity Engine. I got accepted, made some friends who were also going to afse, and I made the first version of my game! Now I'm in AFSE making this blog post. That's it, so here is a non-clickable link to some doggos =) :https://www.google.com/search?q=doggos&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi53v6LoMzdAhXKg-AKHUKuBYEQ_AUIDigB&biw=958&bih=928&safe=active&ssui=on. Bye! </a></p>
