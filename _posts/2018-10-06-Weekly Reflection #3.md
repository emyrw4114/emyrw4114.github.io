This week was a bit better, but I kant remember some of it. I can remember that we started doing this project where we would choose a flag, draw it on paper, and then cut out pieces of colored paper and glue them on to our flag to give them color. I chose the South Korean flag, which is a bit of a challenge. I didn't even finish drawing the flag, but we are getting more time to do this so it's ok. We also learned how to make shapes and equation in racket, but I still could have gone my entire life knowing that it existed. Now for personal stuffs. Last week, I saw my one and only weakness. Pinkfong's baby shark video. I lost half my brain cells the day I saw that video. In other news, the Yankees are in the postseason! I've got nothing else to talk about, so keep making spoopy memes, an Choa for now!
