What I learned this week: how to make a website. I am currently working on stuff for my game from SIA. I hope to finish it soon =). The class is cool, I guess, but right now there isn't much that we've done. I haven't really struggled with much, so I can't report on that. I've got Nothing else to say, so chao for now!
