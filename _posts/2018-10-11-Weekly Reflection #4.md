This week we learned about pair programming, in which one person programms, while someone else corrects, and they do this on the same computer. this is like having an autocorrect on your code.This is kind of neat, but I feel like it would be simpler for to people to do this on seperate computers, like a collaboration. I still hink that racket is unnecesary to learn, especially since there are much better programs to learn (ex. Java, Javascript, C++, Python, Ruby, C, C#, wolfram). Why would anyone make a game in this? nevertheless, I'm still trying my best to learn this and HTML&CSS. NOW ON TO THE PERSONA- i'm just kidding that is coming during the week. BYE!
