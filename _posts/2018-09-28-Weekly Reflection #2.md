so... today,  we started to learn a new kind of programming language called Racket. It's a decendant on another language called Scheme, both of which I don't know ANYTHING about and could have gone my whole life without knowing. we are supposed to make games on these languages, but the example game was trash! no polish, whatsoever. i wish we could use a different programming language, like python or c#.
